### üë§ &nbsp; About me 

I've been coding for more than 10 years. My first ones were dedicated to electronics and C language applications, and since 2018 working as a Python Backend engineer. Along the way I've worked in different roles and technologies, had my own startup, worked as a teacher, my own tech site. For sure coding in all of them. These combinations gave me a expertise to approach the work from different points of view applying high quality to the daily work.

### üíª &nbsp; My Website
     
Having my website was one of my most wanted wishes. Starting to work as a teacher was the kickoff to begin writing articles about topics I am interested in and also creating projects that make the exposed theory a reality, serving both for teaching purposes as well as to any other interested people. So, after more than two years delivering materials in different flavours I achieved the goal to get my own tech platform oriented to Internet of Things, **Goto IoT.** The aim of the platform is to have a website to publish articles about techonologies, a Github Organization to create well documented and easy to use projects and a community where the members can interact each others. 

Due to decided to focus my efforts in Goto IoT, I've been moving most of my repos there. The projects I have here are don't fit within the Goto IoT or they don't follow the quality of Goto IoT projects. The plantorm target is for Spanish speakers.
