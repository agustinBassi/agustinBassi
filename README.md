### üë§ &nbsp; About me 

My coding journey began in 2008, programming embedded systems in C/C++. Since 2018, I've been working primarily as a Python Backend Engineer. Over the years, I've worn many hats ‚Äî from founding my own startup and teaching, to building a tech platform from scratch and contributing to various product teams.

What‚Äôs been consistent throughout is that I coded across all these roles. This diverse background has given me a good perspective on problem-solving, allowing me to bring both technical depth and a quality-first mindset to my daily work.

### üíª &nbsp; Goto IoT, my tech platform

> _**Note**: The platform is targeted to Spanish speakers, use the translator in case you don't read in Spanish._

While teaching in the [IoT Master's Program at the University of Buenos Aires](https://www.fi.uba.ar/posgrado/maestrias/internet-de-las-cosas), I saw a clear need: students lacked a centralized space to access academic content, explore IoT projects, and engage in community-driven discussions. That insight, combined with my passion for open source, led me to create a platform not just for my students ‚Äî but for anyone on the web.

Through the [Goto IoT site](https://www.gotoiot.com/index.html), you can explore a [curated set of articles](https://www.gotoiot.com/pages/articles.html), all following a consistent, easy-to-digest format, as well as [hands-on projects](https://github.com/orgs/gotoiot/repositories?q=sort%3Aname-asc) featuring detailed documentation and a strong focus on user experience. They‚Äôre designed to be simple to follow, with clear setup instructions and well-organized support material. You can also dive into [the wiki]([url](https://github.com/gotoiot/doc/wiki)) for extended documentation and technical deep-dives.

This project reflects my creativity in building reusable projects, my dedication to writing accessible technical content, and my soft skills in teaching and community-building.

### My current Github profile

As I have been focused on Goto IoT, I moved the majority of my repositories there. The projects I previously hosted here no longer reflect my current approach or standards, which is why I've made them private.

As for my backend development work since 2018, those projects are part of private or proprietary codebases, so unfortunately I can‚Äôt share them publicly on GitHub.

If you‚Äôd like to learn more about my work, check out Goto IoT ‚Äî or feel free to reach out for a private conversation. I'm always happy to connect and share insights about my experience and how I approach building software.
