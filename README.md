### üë§ &nbsp; About me 

I started in 2008 by programming embedded systems in C/C++ and since 2018 working as a Python Backend Engineer. Along the way I've worked in different roles and technologies; had my own startup, worked as a teacher, created my own tech platform and worked in different product teams. For sure programming in all of them. These combinations gave me a good variety of experiences to approach the work from different points of view applying high quality to the daily work.

### üíª &nbsp; Goto IoT, my tech platform

> _**Note**: The platform is targeted to Spanish speakers, use the translator in case you don't read in Spanish._

While working as a teacher in the [IoT Master at Buenos Aires University](https://www.fi.uba.ar/posgrado/maestrias/internet-de-las-cosas), I realized that would be great for the students to have a single place to consume academic articles, IoT projects and a community to provide collaborative support and discuss different topics related to IoT. Because of my passion for the open-source world, I opened the platform not only for my students, but also to anybody in the web.

By accessing [the site](https://www.gotoiot.com/index.html) you can see all the articles and projects - [all the articles](https://www.gotoiot.com/pages/articles.html) have the same format whereas [the projects](https://github.com/orgs/gotoiot/repositories?q=sort%3Aname-asc) have excellent documentation with a strong focus in the consumers' experience, making them really easy to follow, to install dependencies and see all the related documentation. Furthermore [the wiki](https://github.com/gotoiot/doc/wiki) provides complementary documentation to the projects' self-contained ones. 

This evidences my creativity for lots reusable projects that can be used as a starting point, for writing easy to follow articles and for teaching people.

### My current Github profile

Due to I focused my efforts in Goto IoT, I've been moving most of my repos there and the ones that I used to have here don't reflect the way I create projects anymore, for that reason I made them private. Regarding the backend projects I've been working on since 2018, all of them are private projects and can't publish them here. Summarizing, if you want to see how I work you can go to the Goto IoT site or have a private conversation to know more about this.
